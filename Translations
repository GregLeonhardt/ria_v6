#       Table Description:
#
#       All lines starting with ( # ) are comments.
#
#       These tables are used to translate words contained within
#       the input recipe file to words in the output file.  Generally
#       they are used to remove abbreviations, translating them back to
#       full words.
#
#       As always there is an exception and this one is that when
#       Meal-Master is selected for the export format, the Unit Of
#       Measurement is translated twice.  The first translation
#       abbreviations are converted to full words.  The second (because
#       Meal-Master has a limited Unit Of Measurement field) translates
#       the full abbreviations into a standardized abbreviation.
#
#       Table Format:
#       The left most column contains the translation output field.  The
#       remaining columns are the input or search fields.
#
#       The base translation table has the output field in title case and
#       the input field in upper case.  The input field will be converted
#       to upper case if it is not already.  As a result, if you modify
#       the table, you can enter the data whoever you want.  As always
#       there is an exception to this rule.  Information in the input
#       field that is one character in length is not converted to upper
#       case.  Otherwise there is no way to determine if the ( T ) was
#       supposed to be ( t ) teaspoon or ( T ) tablespoon.
#
#       Tables are input as a continuous data stream. I.E no blank lines
#       are permitted.  If you wish to separate sections for formatting
#       use ( # ) comment lines.
#
#       You may notice at the end of the Unit Of Measurement table there
#       is no output format.  All input matches will be translated to
#       nothing.  These inputs were sometimes used as filler characters
#       in older recipes.
#
#       The formatted columns used are not required.  They simply make it
#       easier for me to read and revise.  The actual columns are comma
#       ( , ) delimited and may have any number of spaces between them.
#
#       There is no preset limit to the number of entries for each table.
#       Only system resources limit the number of entries each table
#       can contain.
#
#       Table:
#       Each table is identified by a line starting with ( Table: )
#
#       ! ! ! DO NOT CHANGE THESE LINES UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES ! ! !
#
#       Alterations of these lines WILL cause errors when the tables
#       are scanned.
#
#       Field Size:
#       All output and input strings are limited to 29 characters.
#       Anything larger will be truncated.
#
#       Plural Words:
#       In all cases the plural use of an input (or search for) word is
#       not accounted for.  Thus, many words require multiple search
#       strings.  For example ( bag ) and ( bags ).
#
#       History:
#       Once upon a time these tables were hard coded into the program.
#       The unfortunate side effect of this is that when new conversion
#       are required, the program needed to be recompiled.  This method
#       though efficient during execution of the program was a pain in
#       the .....
#
#       Status:
#       These tables are NOT nor will they ever be complete.  There will
#       always be somebody out there inventing another way to abbreviate
#       a word, create a new category or something.  Plan on modifying
#       this file.

Table: Unit Of Measurement
#
#       This table is used when translating unit of measurements within
#       the ingredients section of the recipe.
#
#       If the amount field is greater then one, the translated word
#       is converted to plural. Example ( Bag ) will be converted into
#       ( Bags ) if more then one is called for in the amount field.
#
#       NOTE:  The maximum length for a Unit Of Measurement is 12 bytes

Table: Abbreviations
#
#       The abbreviations section is used when formatting recipe directions.
#
#       Many recipes use abbreviations in the directions simply to reduce
#       the amount of typing.  The person entering the recipe naturally
#       assumes whoever is reading the recipe (normally intended for
#       personal use) has the same knowledge as they do.  This program
#       makes the assumption that nobody knows anything and wishes to
#       make all information within a recipe as easy to understand as
#       possible.

Table: Paragraph Starters
#
#       This section is used when formatting recipe directions.
#
#       It is a special case table where there is not a TO string
#       because it is simply used to detect the search strings.
#
#       Many recipes sent over the internet have been formatted,
#       reformatted, re-re-formatted.......  Though (in most cases)
#       the original information still exists, it has become a jumbled
#       mess of information requiring the current user to read and
#       reread several times to understand.  The following is a list of
#       keywords that this program will use to detect what once were
#       probably separate paragraphs.  If they were not they should have
#       been.
#
#       In addition to the following list.  Sentences starting with
#       numbers or (hopefully) Roman numerals will also start new
#       paragraphs.
