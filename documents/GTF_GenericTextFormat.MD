#   GENERIC IMPORT FORMAT

Following is the EXACT format that MasterCook expects when using the
"generic import" feature. You will find that it takes very little time
and effort to put most unformatted text recipes into this format.

NOTE: The descriptive comments appearing inside the bracket signs,
"\[ \]", are NOT a part of the format and appear here only for
clarification.

1st line: @@@@@  \[that's 5 "at" signs\]
2nd line: TITLE of the recipe
3rd line: BLANK \[this MUST be BLANK, not spaces!\]
4th line: NOTES -- ONE line of text.
5th line: BLANK \[again, no spaces or non-display characters!\]
6th line: amount unit ingredient preparation method
   .
   . \[amount, unit, prep method are optional\]
   .
Last INGREDIENT  \[up to 100 ingredients\]
BLANK  \[once again, no spaces!\]
DIRECTIONS and any "free form" text you wish to include. These lines are
optional.

####    NOTE: Everything until the next "@@@@@" will be put in the direction
section. You can add the "recipe by", "serving size", and
"categories" once the recipes have been imported.

####    NOTE: Even if you do not normally use the "Notes" section, one line of
notes is REQUIRED by this format. You may insert any one or more text
characters to fulfill this requirement.

####    TIP: Hate the tedium of deleting all those preceding spaces on each line
of your recipe? Well, there's no need to! With the exception of the
"@@@@@", the lines in the generic format do NOT have to be left
justified. Each text line may be preceded by non-printing characters, such
as spaces.

####    TIP: The easiest way to force the "preparation method" into the
"preparation method field" is to place either a comma or a semi-colon
after the ingredient. (Ex., 1 small onion, chopped --OR-- 1 small onion;
chopped)

####    TIP:  A BLANK line MUST truly be BLANK. The import will not work
correctly if any non-displayable characters, such as spaces, are
contained in a "blank" line. If you are experiencing difficulty
importing a recipe, it may be helpful to view the recipe with an editor
(ex., WordPerfect, MS Word, Notepad, BBedit, etc.) that will display
non-printable characters. Only the end-of-line delimiters (carriage
returns,line feeds, etc) should be in a blank line.

####    TIP: If a recipe is not left justified in an email message, what appears
to be blank lines are most likely lines with spaces. So, if the original
recipe is indented, be sure to delete and replace every blank line.

####    TIP: Make sure that where a blank line is required, there is only ONE blank
line. If more than one blank is encountered, the importer may not store
the recipe properly.

####    TIP: EVERYTHING following the first direction line until the next
"@@@@@" is encountered will be imported as directions. Therefore, you
need to delete any extraneous text (such as email signatures) that you
do not want stored as part of your recipe. When using the generic
format, MC will not strip out trailing text that is not part of your
recipe.

####    TIP: Recipes are posted on the Internet in a very wide variety of styles
and formats. Sometimes the ingredients are embedded within sentences and
it may be difficult to ready the recipe for importing. In these
instances, you may find it easier to manually enter the recipe using MC
fast-fill feature and doing a copy and paste of the directions.
