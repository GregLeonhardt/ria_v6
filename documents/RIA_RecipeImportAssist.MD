### EXAMPLE:

-----  Recipe Import Assist Start -----
Spanish Fried Steak-Mom'S

Description: ?

4       cup         water
16      tablespoon  catsup
16      tablespoon  onion
1       clove       garlic minced
16      tablespoon  celery sliced, or tops
                    salt and pepper
1/2     cup         flour
                    lard or shortening

I don't know why Mom called it Spanish-probably the tomato.  I like it best thick, and with mashed, or baked potato it was so good.  Enjoy.  

Add shortening to large pan.  

Saute minced garlic.  Dip pieces of meat in flour, salt and pepper mixture.  Fry in hot fat.  Drop in kettle of water (4 cups) and add remaining ingredients.  

When meat is done, about 4 hours on low heat, it can be thickened with flour and water.  Adapts to Crockpot cooking.
