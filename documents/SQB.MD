### EXAMPLE:

[[[[[
Squash Casserole

2 pounds yellow squash
2 medium tomatoes, sliced
Salt and pepper, to taste
2 medium onions, sliced
1/2 cup Parmesan Cheese
1/4 cup Margarine, (1/2 stick)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Peel and slice squash into
rounds about 1/2" thick. Place about 1/3 of the sliced squash
in the bottom of a baking dish, add a 1/3 of the tomatoes, salt
and pepper, 1/3 of the onions and 1/3 of the cheese. Dot with
1/3 of the margarine. Repeat with additional two layers. Cover
with foil and bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove the
foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes.

Serves 4-6.

NOTE:
    The above example does not include the recipe end marker
    "-----" found in recipes posted.  I don't know if this is
    a mistake or just something that is present in the recipes
    I have looked at.
]]]]]

### NOTES:

*   Many descriptions of this format floating around the internet do NOT
require the set of closing brackets that end the recipe.  I have done my
best at following this 'standard' there is a significant problem with it.
When they are omitted, there is no way of knowing that any text following
the last recipe is part of the recipe directions or just something the
publisher added as a comment, note or any other random text.
